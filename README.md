# Aisaar
Aisaar a  `Charity Management Network` I developed as a semester project for my `Database Systems` in my 4th semster

This project aims to provide a centralized platform for charity Franchises/organizations to manage their operations, including franchise management, there registration, donor management, fundraising campaigns, volunteer coordination along with specific project planning, proposal and there creation, monitoring complains of volunteers. The system should streamline administrative control, enhance donation control, and improve transparency in charity operations.

## Functionalities

</br>
To create such a network to streamline Such Functionalities I implemented following features to cater the problem:
- Creation and management of franchises, projects, volunteer, campaigns, and beneficiaries.
- Admin registering different franchises holding multiple projects, volunteers and campaigns as well as beneficiaries. 
- Proper authentication system for Franchises, Volunteers, Donors as well as the Admin
- Volunteer proposing different projects and getting approved from individual franchises. 
- Tracking of donations made by donors to specific projects and campaigns. 
- Maintaining the record of Donorâ€™s donations(Transactions made)
- Monitoring fundraising campaigns associated directly to franchises. 
- Publishing Top Donorâ€™s testimonials on Home Page.
- Monitoring Top volunteer who have completed most projects.
- Receiving complaints from volunteers and resolving their problems from Admin.
- Managing beneficiaries enrollment, status and skills they are acquiring within franchises.
- Maintaining record of completed Projects and franchises.  
- Maintaining the filtration of beneficiaries with respect to their status of enrollment in each franchise(orphan, widow, other).
