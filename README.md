# Aisaar
Aisaar is a `Charity Management Network` developed as a semester project for `Database Systems` in my 4th semester. This project provides a centralized platform for charity franchises/organizations to manage their operations, including franchise management, registration, donor management, fundraising campaigns, volunteer coordination, project planning, proposal creation, and monitoring volunteer complaints. The system streamlines administrative control, enhances donation transparency, and improves operational efficiency for charity organizations.
