# Aisaar
#### `Aisaar` a "Charity Management Network" network whose aim is to provide a centralized platform for charity Franchises/organizations to manage their operations, including franchise management, there registration, donor management, fundraising campaigns, volunteer coordination along with specific project planning, proposal and there creation, monitoring complains of volunteers. The system should streamline administrative control, enhance donation control, and improve transparency in charity operations.

# Functionalities
### To create such a network to streamline Such Functionalities I implemented following features to cater the problem:
- Creation and management of franchises, projects, volunteer, campaigns, and beneficiaries.
- Admin registering different franchises holding multiple projects, volunteers and campaigns as well as beneficiaries. 
- Proper authentication system for Franchises, Volunteers, Donors as well as the Admin
- Volunteer proposing different projects and getting approved from individual franchises. 
- Tracking of donations made by donors to specific projects and campaigns. 
- Maintaining the record of Donor’s donations(Transactions made)
- Monitoring fundraising campaigns associated directly to franchises. 
- Publishing Top Donor’s testimonials on Home Page.
- Monitoring Top volunteer who have completed most projects.
- Receiving complaints from volunteers and resolving their problems from Admin.
- Managing beneficiaries enrollment, status and skills they are acquiring within franchises.
- Maintaining record of completed Projects and franchises.  
- Maintaining the filtration of beneficiaries with respect to their status of enrollment in each franchise(orphan, widow, other). 

## In case this doesnt work, follow these steps as an alternative and Install required Dependancies
At first create a React App using following command:

```bash
   npx create-react-app charity-system
```
 Clone the project using following command
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/BazilSuhail/ClientSide-Charity-Network.git
```
Go to the project directory
```bash
cd my-project
```
Just for convenience copy all contents in the cloned repository and paste them into the directory where You have 
created your **React App**.
 
Afterwards simply run this command to install all required dependancies and packages at once.
```bash
npm i firebase react-icons react-router-dom react-toastify  react-responsive-carousel react-simple-typewriter
```
Start the server

```bash
  npm start
```
